Lower flows can also lead to lower oil temperatures, again leading to water freezing and corrosion.</p>    <p>Lower oil temperatures can cause soil surrounding the pipeline to freeze &ndash; frost heaves can cause movement in the pipeline itself, leading to damage.</p>    <p>At some point, as these problems grow worse, the pipeline could be forced to shut down, putting North Slope oil production into jeopardy altogether.</p>    <p>As a result, the Alaskan government is keen to see more oil fields come online.</p>    <p>&ldquo;In this day and age of technology and regulatory requirements, I am sure it will be done safely,&rdquo; Alaskan governor Bill Walker said after the Caelus Energy discovery was announced.</p>    <p>&ldquo;We look forward to the discovery being turned into oil in the pipeline.&rdquo; Caelus estimates that the field could eventually produce 200,000 barrels per day, which would substantially extend the life of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.</p>    <p>State support does not mean the oil field will necessarily move forward. Caelus has drilled two wells, and needs to drill another in order to learn more about the field. But drilling can only be conducted in winter months when the ground is frozen. The company is not prepared to drill this winter, so it can&rsquo;t proceed with another well until early 2018. Development costs, not to mention the cost to construct the pipeline, will be steep &ndash; on the order of $8 to $10bn.</p>    <p>Higher oil prices are probably needed for full-scale development to make sense &ndash; as high as $65 per barrel plus &ldquo;certainty on state tax policy and incentives,&rdquo; Musselman told Bloomberg.</p>    <p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/251056/oil-prices-slide-almost-one-per-cent-doubts-over-cuts-non\" target=\"_self\">Oil prices slide over output fears for non-Opec&nbsp;producers</a></p>    <p>&ldquo;A lot of the investment decision is going to revolve around what happens within the state from a regulatory standpoint,&rdquo; he said.</p>    <p>But if things go according to plan, production could begin in 2022.</p>    <p>&ldquo;It is a massively complex, massively expensive undertaking to get that (oil) to market,&rdquo; Cody Rice, a principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.</p>    <p>But with Royal Dutch Shell and other oil majors abandoning offshore drilling in the Arctic, Caelus&rsquo; shallow-water discovery could be one of Alaska&rsquo;s last best hopes to keep its oil industry alive.</p>    <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.cityam.com/assets/uploads/content/2016/10/nick0610a-57fb769f99d06.png\"></p>    <p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/New-Mega-Oil-Discovery-In-Alaska-Could-Reverse-3-Decades-Of-Decline.html\" target=\"_blank\">OilPrice.com</a></em></p>','2016-10-10 12:00:00','2016-10-10 14:58:13','2016-10-10 14:58:13'),

The European Commission itself (which has no incentive to underestimate) believes this common regulatory zone has raised EU-wide GDP by just 2.1 per cent overall. That figure was calculated for 2008, at the height of the boom. As the economist Andrew Lilico has outlined, for the UK we can imagine this would be less significant still: the UK trades less with other EU members than the EU average and specialises in services where the Single Market is less complete. We were also already fairly liberal in regulatory terms during this period (meaning the benefits from any harmonisation measures would be less pronounced for us).</p>    <p class=\"caption\"><img alt=\"Jean-Claude Juncker\" src=\"http://www.cityam.com/assets/uploads/getty/topshot-france-eu-parliament-612791344.jpg\"><br>  Even the European Commission believes the Single Market only raises GDP by just over 2 per cent (Source: Getty)</p>    <p>The Treasury believes that, despite this, <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/243199/how-the-treasurys-dodgy-dossiers-grossly-exaggerated-the-economic-impact-of-brexit\">leaving the Single Market could somehow cost up to 6 per cent of GDP in the long term</a>. But this is based on huge dynamic gains, for which there is little to no historical evidence. Indeed, in future we expect EU trade to become relatively less important. Despite hopes for a flexible economy able to adjust to the changing pattern of global demand, Single Market membership would mean 100 per cent of the economy would continue to be bound by often damaging regulation emanating from Brussels. This should be of particular worry to the City, given the EU&rsquo;s frequent attacks on so-called &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon&rdquo; finance. Indeed, as Remainers helpfully pointed out during the campaign, the Single Market solution is undesirable post-Brexit because we could no longer vote against new regulation imposed upon us.</p>    <p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/240684/the-norway-option-is-far-from-just-paying-into-the-eu-without-having-a-say\">The Norway option is far from just paying into the EU without having a say</a></p>    <p>This is not the only risk. Staying in the Single Market would mean a continuation of budget payments to the EU (net 0.5 per cent of GDP), something only likely to rise given the centralising ambitions of Brussels. The need for the Eurozone to integrate further to solve the euro crisis also risks the institutions of the EU increasingly being dominated by a single currency bloc, potentially to the detriment of the UK.</p>    <p>What business might fear is a big bang &ndash; a changed tariff and regulatory environment all in one go. But steps can be taken to mitigate the transition. The depreciation of the pound already vastly outweighs any adverse tariff effect on exporters to the EU. Last week&rsquo;s announcement that <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/250915/dont-blame-businesses-hiring-foreign-staff-improve-british\">existing EU workers have a right to remain within the UK </a>negates risks for businesses employing EU staff. And the government&rsquo;s Great Repeal Bill, through repatriating the body of EU law and regulation, means any changes to the regulatory environment would be incremental. It also means the EU should be willing to agree to an equivalence tariff-free arrangement on the point of exit &ndash; given the mutually beneficial nature of free trade.</p>    <p class=\"caption\"><img alt=\"European Central Bank To Announce Bond-Buying Program\" src=\"http://www.cityam.com/assets/uploads/getty/european-central-bank-to-announce-bond-buying-program-461890954.jpg\"><br>  It\'s best to be beyond the reach of the Eurozone\'s centralising ambitions (Source: Getty)</p>    <p>Whether we become a more &ldquo;open&rdquo; or &ldquo;closed&rdquo; economy has nothing per se to do with the Single Market.

How can we use Nobel Prize-winning insights &ndash; rather than anecdote and shooting from the hip &ndash; to guide the current debate on executive pay?</p>    <p>Most academic research is empirical &ndash; using real-world data to identify correlations, and in some cases causations. Empirical research is illuminating, but typically only tells us what does happen, not what should happen. In particular, it can only study policies that are already in place.</p>    <p>But many of the proposals for compensation reform are hypothetical &ndash; they aren&rsquo;t currently practised, so we have no data on them. This is where theoretical research &ndash; Hart and Holmstrom&rsquo;s methodology &ndash; comes in. &ldquo;Theoretical&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;abstract&rdquo;. Instead, a good theory constructs a model of the firm-worker relationship, changes certain variables (such as the strength of incentives), and studies the outcome &ndash; similar to a flight or city simulator. Of course, the predictions of any model depend on its assumptions. Hart and Holmstrom&rsquo;s theories have become particularly influential due to their realistic assumptions, and their predictions have subsequently been supported in the data.</p>    <p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/222214/what-future-forecasts-it-s-time-economists-grappled-flaws-their-models\">It&rsquo;s time economists grappled with the flaws in their models</a></p>    <p>Arguably Holmstrom&rsquo;s most famous paper shows that employees should only be paid for performance under their control. This suggests executives should be rewarded for firm-specific but not industry performance. While seemingly obvious, this principle is often ignored in real life. <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/243210/are-leading-investors-wrong-to-criticise-house-builder-persimmon-for-its-600m-executive-bonus-pot\">For example, homebuilder Persimmon gave its executives a &pound;600m reward for strong stock price performance when it was due to a buoyant housing market</a>.</p>    <p>A paper with Stanford&rsquo;s Paul Milgrom studies contracts when the worker has to balance many competing priorities. Paying according to one performance measure will cause the worker to ignore others. Again, while intuitive, this principle is often violated. Concerns to avoid &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; pay led to clauses cancelling executives&rsquo; equity if they miss certain performance targets &ndash; and so they take short-term actions to meet these targets. Theresa May advocates linking executive pay to worker pay, <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/article/1399491297/how-regulating-executive-pay-can-increase-inequality-not-reduce-it\">which may cause the executive to neglect other dimensions of social responsibility (such as customers, suppliers, and the environment) &ndash; and indeed other dimensions of worker reward, such as on-the-job training.</a></p>    <p>A separate paper with Milgrom shows that, under certain conditions (subsequently relaxed), the optimal contract is linear. Pay should rise gradually with good performance and fall gradually with bad performance &ndash; with no kinks or step-changes. <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/249082/pressure-pay-reform-may-now-irresistible\">This contrasts with MP Chris Philp&rsquo;s argument that pay should have a maximum</a>. Such pay caps incentivise executives to build good firms, but then to preserve the status quo rather than go from good to great. It also contradicts the use of options, where the executive&rsquo;s downside is limited upon poor performance, and step-change forfeiture of equity upon missing short-term performance targets.</p>    <p>Some of Hart&rsquo;s contributions are on incomplete contracts. Contracts aren&rsquo;t perfect &ndash; there are many decisions that can&rsquo;t be enforced by a contract. Who should decide what decisions are taken when the contract is silent? The answer is the party who bears the long-term consequences of these decisions. In a firm context, this is shareholders. Evidence shows that the long-term stock price reflects not just shareholder value, but stakeholder value. In contrast, giving decisions to employees (also proposed by May) is suboptimal. Employees are less affected by decisions that affect customers, suppliers, and the environment, and so may not take these decisions optimally.</p>    <p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/245952/beware-unintended-consequences-theresa-mays-flawed\">Beware the unintended consequences of May&rsquo;s flawed executive pay proposals</a></p>    <p>Both Hart and Holmstrom emphasise how contracts don&rsquo;t just provide incentives, but also achieve risk-sharing. Thus, even if employees are intrinsically motivated, incentive contracts are still valuable. Banker bonuses can be cut in a downturn, ensuring the bank&rsquo;s solvency. <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/230958/bank-of-england-warns-eu-bonus-cap-has-increased-risk-of-instability-in-the-financial-sector\">The European Union&rsquo;s bonus cap has replaced bonuses with salaries, which are harder to cut and thus increase bank risk</a>. In addition, executives are less risk-averse than employees. This is why bonuses are higher for executives &ndash; and on the flipside, poor company performance leads to pay cuts for executives (Burberry&rsquo;s Christopher Bailey lost 75 per cent in 2015) but not employees. This also suggests that executive pay should not be linked to worker pay.</p>    <p>Finally, both Laureates emphasised that the optimal contract is not one-size-fits-all &ndash; it differs from firm to firm, and from employee to employee. While regulations aim to impose common rules for everyone (for example, by shaming any firm whose ratio of executive to worker pay exceeds the average), the diversity of contracts should reflect the diversity of the economy.</p>','2016-10-10 18:00:00','2016-10-10 18:05:07','2016-10-10 18:05:07'),

It has to be about both.</p>    <p>At &pound;7.8bn, a second runway at Gatwick would be half the cost of Heathrow&rsquo;s third runway. And while Gatwick&rsquo;s expansion would be 100 per cent privately funded, Heathrow expansion would require at least &pound;5bn of public funds for improvements to the road and rail network, according to the Airports Commission.</p>    <p>I&rsquo;ve spent much of my career working in the travel industry; I started selling flight tickets out of a kiosk at Earls Court in 1980, and I launched Ebookers in 1999, helping people benefit from the boom in low-cost air travel. But low air fares aren&rsquo;t just about the family holiday. They&rsquo;ve also helped millions of the UK&rsquo;s small and medium-sized businesses travel, and export, overseas. Lower airport charges &ndash; like those at Gatwick &ndash; are crucial to keeping prices down.</p>    <p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/213514/flights-philanthropy\">From flights to philanthropy with Ebookers\' founder</a></p>    <p>Heathrow is already one of the most expensive airports in the world, and its passenger charges (which are added to the price you pay for a ticket) would likely rise to over &pound;40 per passenger to fund their expensive plans. Gatwick, on the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/blog/1395754317/gatwick-states-obvious-fight-new-runway\">has committed to keep passenger charges below &pound;15 &ndash; which it can do because of the lower costs of its proposals</a>.</p>    <p>Furthermore, unlike Heathrow, Gatwick already has land set aside for expansion, which can be delivered by 2025; even using the most optimistic of projections, Heathrow won&rsquo;t be delivered before 2030.</p>    <p>While both schemes would have an environmental impact, Heathrow expansion would newly affect hundreds of thousands of local people, whereas Gatwick would affect less than 5 per cent of that number.</p>    <p>Ultimately, the Airports Commission found that either Heathrow or Gatwick expansion would deliver virtually the same number of additional long-haul and short-haul routes. Whereas Gatwick wins hands down on costs and environmental issues, however, Heathrow has a larger catchment area and is already running at close to 100 per cent capacity.</p>    <p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/247605/quit-government-over-heathrow-expansion-why-changed-my-mind\">I quit government over Heathrow expansion: This is why I changed my mind</a></p>    <p>So Gatwick is the greener option, and it can be delivered more quickly and more cheaply. But given that it takes 10 to 15 years to build a new runway, I believe that Heathrow needs one too. The conversation should be about building two runways, one each for Heathrow and Gatwick, and a high-speed rail link between London&rsquo;s two airports.</p>    <p>Our competition is Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and even Dubai. If we really do intend to show that Britain is open for business, the government needs to back Gatwick as the quicker option, and to back Heathrow at the same time.</p>','2016-10-10 18:30:00','2016-10-10 18:35:06','2016-10-10 18:35:06'),

	(58,'Done right, fiscal policy can channel QE into the real economy','http://www.cityam.com/251136/done-right-fiscal-policy-can-act-channel-direct-monetary','<p>It\'s scarcely&nbsp;possible to read about global economic policy these days without hearing that central banks have run out of ammunition and a call to open the fiscal floodgates. But is fiscal policy really the answer to whatever is ailing the global economy? And has the great monetary experiment really reached the end of the road? We think not.</p>    <p>We&rsquo;re willing to concede that expansionary fiscal policy &ndash; more public spending &ndash; will lead to stronger economic growth when the policy is active, and that fiscal stimulus is likely to have a more direct and immediate impact on output than monetary stimulus. There are still question marks surrounding magnitudes, of course, but a switch towards a more active use of fiscal policy should therefore be positive for global growth, at least in the short term. But there are important caveats.</p>    <p>Most proponents of fiscal expansion still look at it through a conventional demand-management or business-cycle lens, in which a quick dose of stimulus is enough to push the economy back onto a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; path. And fiscal fine-tuning of this type would be the right medicine if we were facing a conventional business-cycle recession.</p>    <p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/250563/hammond-warns-over-brexit-complacency-he-scraps-osbornes\">Hammond warns over Brexit complacency as he scraps fiscal surplus goal</a></p>    <p>But what if economies face more persistent headwinds, such as the deleveraging phase of a debt supercycle or secular stagnation &ndash; a period of very low or no growth which is not cyclical or short term? Under those circumstances, a temporary burst of fiscal stimulus is unlikely to help much, and growth is likely to slip back once the stimulus has worn off. Ultimately, fiscal policy might be viewed with the same disdain as QE is today.</p>    <p>That&rsquo;s where the idea of permanent fiscal stimulus comes in. Nobody has grasped this nettle yet, though Japan has come closest. However, this would require permanent support from monetary policy, which brings us to a crucial point. Fiscal policy should not be seen as an alternative to monetary policy but as working in concert with it: &ldquo;joined at the hip&rdquo;, as we like to call it.</p>    <p>This raises another important question: does monetary policy support fiscal policy, or should we think about it the other way around? In other words, is fiscal policy a way of channelling monetary stimulus into the real economy instead of asset prices, as has been the case with QE? More and more, we think this might be the case, or at least that the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy is blurred.</p>    <p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/250567/japans-imaginative-monetary-policy-putting-banks-danger\">Japan\'s imaginative monetary policy is putting banks in danger</a></p>    <p>It&rsquo;s through this blurred lens that we should consider the Bank of Japan&rsquo;s latest actions, which strengthened the delivery of monetary stimulus in several key ways. Beyond the eye-catching introduction of explicit yield-curve targeting, which will see the central bank buying bonds to keep 10-year yields at about 0 per cent, two particular aspects of &ldquo;QQE with Yield Curve Control&rdquo; stand out.</p>    <p>First, the BoJ is committed to continue expanding the monetary base until inflation is above 2 per cent and set to stay there. This new &ldquo;inflation-overshooting commitment&rdquo; means the BoJ has implicitly raised its inflation target: 2 per cent is now the floor, not the midpoint. The aim here is to reset inflation expectations at a higher level, without which the BoJ will struggle to create permanently higher inflation &ndash; as the European Central Bank is also starting to discover.</p>    <p>Second, the BoJ has explicitly recognised the need for policy coordination. It said in September that it &ldquo;believes that its monetary policy and the government&rsquo;s fiscal policy [&hellip;] will produce synergy effects, and thereby will navigate Japan&rsquo;s economy toward overcoming deflation and achieving sustainable growth&rdquo;.</p>    <p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/249777/bank-japan-tweaks-policy-fight-inflation\">Bank of Japan gets imaginative in fight for inflation</a></p>    <p>Part of that policy coordination is about monetary policy anchoring bond yields and giving fiscal policy more room for manoeuvre. But, as noted earlier, coordination can also work the other way. Fiscal policy can act as a channel to ensure that money created by the central bank is directed at spending on goods and services and therefore more likely to create traditional inflation, particularly against a backdrop of tight capacity, as is the case in Japan. Moreover, permanent fiscal stimulus would have a powerful impact on inflation expectations, especially if it&rsquo;s made explicit that any deficits will be monetised.</p>    <p>Despite the growing clamour for a more active use of fiscal policy, we&rsquo;re sceptical that conventional fiscal stimulus will act as anything other than a short-term palliative. But if implemented on a sufficient scale (in terms of magnitude and duration), there&rsquo;s every reason to believe that joint monetary and fiscal stimulus will lead to a sustained rise in inflation. It&rsquo;s just a question of who&rsquo;s going to try it first? Unsurprisingly, our money&rsquo;s on Japan.</p>','2016-10-11 04:25:00','2016-10-11 07:55:59','2016-10-11 07:55:59'),

If it goes ahead, who is going to pick up the bill to maintain it?&rdquo;</p>  </blockquote>    <p>Labour MP Hillier also cautioned on the \"pattern of behaviour\" whereby the Trust repeatedly asked the DfT for more money when it encountered challenges, and was granted it, to <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/234849/saving-britains-charities-the-role-of-the-finance-function\">the collapse of the Kids Company charity</a>. \"I hope the government learned its lesson,\" she said.</p>    <p>The investigation found that there still remains a significant risk that the project won&rsquo;t go ahead as the Garden Bridge Trust charity that&rsquo;s in charge of building and maintaining the bridge, hasn&rsquo;t yet secured the land on the South Bank for the Bridge&rsquo;s south landing. Construction is expected to begin 18 months later than planned in the spring of 2017.</p>    <p>The independent government watchdog has been examining the Department for Transport&rsquo;s (DfT) decision to commit &pound;30m of central government cash to the &pound;175m proposed pedestrian bridge and garden. It also looked at the decision to increase the amount that it was willing to commit on three occasions, before construction started.</p>    <p class=\"caption\"><img alt=\"George Osborne made the initial decision to help finance the scheme\" src=\"http://www.cityam.com/assets/uploads/getty/george-osborne-leaves-downing-street-ahead-of-the-budget-vote-516917686.jpg\"><br>  George Osborne made the initial decision to help finance the scheme (Source: Getty)</p>    <p>The NAO noted that the initial funding commitments to the project were made by the former Chancellor <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/244990/chancellor-george-osborne-has-secured-backing-five\">George Osborne</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/245551/foreign-secretary-boris-johnson-bookies-favourite-leave\">Boris Johnson</a>, without the involvement of the DfT.

	(67,'Is £2bn enough to fix the housing market?','http://www.cityam.com/251166/2bn-enough-fix-housing-market','<p>Last week the government announced <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/250540/philip-hammond-announce-5bn-homebuilding-stimulus-package\">plans for a &pound;2bn accelerated construction fund</a> that will be used to guarantee housing schemes, including deals to purchase homes that do not sell.</p>    <p>The guarantee, which will be achieved by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) directly selling any &lsquo;government purchased homes&rsquo; on the market, to the private rented sector, institutional investors, or registered social landlords, will in the words of new HCA Chairman, Sir Eddie Lister, &lsquo;guarantee money&rsquo; and help minimise risk for developers.</p>    <p>On the face of it this is excellent news. For too long government and the industry have talked about <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/247777/small-housebuilders-answer-housing-crisis-heres-we-can-help\">the need to diversify the sector and bring back the smaller builders who suffered</a>, and in many cases went out of business, during the last recession.</p>    <p>However, I would put the party poppers away for now and consider the possible unintended consequences of government intervention.</p>    <p>Underwriting sales values will ensure that <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/250632/better-infrastructure-and-new-houses-heres-invest-post\">developers can carry on securing funding should economic uncertainty during the two-year Brexit negotiations squeeze the market</a>. But, the government will take on the sales risk, while the market wants to off-load. This is not a sustainable solution.</p>    <p>When a government intervenes in a market which has failed and seeks to support it, the result is that when eventually the cost of supporting it becomes too much, the market correction is severe and for those whose business model has been supported, catastrophic.</p>    <p>My prediction is that when details of the construction fund are in place we will get a very short-term production increase, which will only be sustainable for as long as the money is pumped in. The affordability of homes will not increase and the underlying dysfunctional nature of the market will not be changed, and if I am wrong any increase in production will be stifled by the growing skills shortage &ndash; which will be exacerbated by possible constraints on the free movement of people.</p>    <p>The seriousness of the government&rsquo;s desire to resolve the housing crises cannot be doubted. The continued interventions in buyer support, developer support, incentives to local authorities and tweaks to the planning system demonstrate this commitment. However, these efforts have not been rewarded with a functioning market.</p>    <p>If the government wants to create a self-sustaining model that unlocks the supply and affordability of housing, while not throwing vast amounts of public money at the problem, then there are solutions available, but they require a number of changes.</p>    <p>First, reform tenure structures to give people an incentive to invest in their communities as a result of long-term access to good quality, affordable housing; second, invest in more efficient forms of construction so that the market can respond quickly to changes in demand; and third, <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/245538/uk-should-building-300000-homes-year-tackle-housing-crisis\">reform planning conditions to remove delays in the delivery of new build properties</a>.</p>    <p>The unintended consequence of the delay caused by negotiating planning obligations is higher prices, which are required to ensure that capital contributions can be sustained. This combination lowers rates of sales and slows the delivery process.</p>    <p>The solutions and the majority of the mechanisms are already available, and there is minimal need for new primary legislation, but it will require some joined-up thinking between government departments, local government and industry &ndash; all of which are easily achievable.</p>    <p>While there has been a modest short-term increase in production, from a very low base, the long-term trend has remained stubbornly downwards, with ever reducing affordability, in the face of growing demand.</p>','2016-10-11 09:35:00','2016-10-11 09:40:06','2016-10-11 09:40:06'),
	(68,'Small businesses aren&amp;#039;t thinking global. Here&amp;#039;s how to change it','http://www.cityam.com/251169/small-businesses-arent-thinking-global-heres-change','<p>From Theresa May promising to negotiate &ldquo;maximum freedom&rdquo; within the Single Market post-Brexit, to international trade secretary Liam Fox stating that the UK will &ldquo;lead the charge&rdquo; towards a world of open and fair business, international trade took centre stage at the Conservative party conference last week.</p>    <p>This, of course, would have come as little surprise. Post-referendum,&nbsp;the need for UK businesses to look beyond our shores and those of Europe has taken on much greater importance. I call this newly required mind set &lsquo;think global&rsquo;.</p>    <p>In fact, the ability of UK businesses to successfully increase the amount of trade they currently undertake with international partners will be crucial to the future success of the UK as a whole, so the stakes are high. To put some numbers to this, a recent report by World First and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR)&nbsp;found that due to the small and medium-sized&nbsp;export shortfall, the UK economy is losing out on &pound;141bn a year &ndash; that&rsquo;s more than the current health and defence budgets combined.</p>    <p>It is not just about UK plc either. Increasing international trade, particularly through exporting, is one of the best ways for businesses to accelerate their growth. In the current climate in which we find ourselves &ndash; a hugely weakened pound and the chance to reset our existing global position &ndash; the opportunity for smaller businesses&nbsp;to trade across borders is now. Our research shows, the typical SME&nbsp;exporter generates an additional &pound;287,000 a year in revenue, thereby highlighting the size of the prize at hand.</p>    <p>But barriers persist. From culture and language, to logistics and regulation, taking the first steps to exporting can be daunting &ndash; and of course this is not to mention the barrier generated by the uncertainty presented by Brexit. As a result, only 5 per cent&nbsp;of SMEs have plans to start exporting in the next five years, which if it doesn&rsquo;t change, could pour cold water on the Government&rsquo;s vision for the future.</p>    <p>Consequently it is clear to see that much more needs to be done in terms of inspiration and practical support for smaller firms&nbsp;to help them seize the growth opportunities that exist in global markets. I believe there are two key things that need to be done in order to achieve this.</p>    <h2>&lsquo;Scale up&rsquo; minister</h2>    <p>The creation of a government &nbsp;minister for scale-ups could go a long way in supporting businesses in their international development and drastically improve exporting figures in the UK. A representative in this capacity would spearhead the movement for increasing exporting overseas by improving trading conditions abroad, promoting the benefits of expansion and offering greater support to SMEs looking to make the leap from domestic to international markets.</p>    <p>Why is this needed when we already have ministers promoting trade? In my view, whilst blue chip and start&nbsp;up companies are well supported, those in the middle and the lower-middle market who may not have ever thought about exporting but have huge scale up potential, are often overlooked. This is where a dedicated scale up minister would come in.</p>    <h2>Refined industry strategy</h2>    <p>As part of the process of encouraging SMEs to engage with new markets, the government must take the time to identify the industries that would benefit from exporting more and which markets they would be most successful in.</p>    <p>Beyond the EU&nbsp;Single Market, there is significant untapped potential in emerging economies and SMEs should be encouraged every step of the way to explore such opportunities. Conversely, other sectors may benefit from more established markets such as the US or Canada. It is vital that SMEs are supported with a well-devised government-led industry strategy to ensure whichever markets they are looking to enter make the most strategic sense.</p>    <p>Through these initiatives, it&rsquo;s hoped that we can change the mindset of our SMEs from one that doesn&rsquo;t consider the opportunities of international expansion or views it as unobtainable, to motivate them into action and inspire them to think bigger.</p>    <p>For me, it is clear that the rewards outweigh risks, both for individual businesses and on a macroeconomic level, and in such a time of change for the UK, there has never been a more important moment for SMEs to seize the opportunities offered by international trade.</p>    <p>Now is the time to think global.</p>','2016-10-11 10:11:00','2016-10-11 10:15:07','2016-10-11 10:15:07'),
